[NAME=Spark][SPEAKERSPRITE=]What do you need?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]My motorcycle broke down.
[NAME=Spark][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Why should I care?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]I guess you don't have too.
I need your help.
[NAME=Spark][SPEAKERSPRITE=]What makes you think I want to help some random person?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]The quicker you help me, the quicker I can leave.
[NAME=Spark][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Fine. What can I help you with?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Do you know what motorcycle parts I need?
[NAME=Spark][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Let me scan the area for motorcycles.
...
I've found one broken motorcycle in the area. It is located next to the southern barrier. Would this be yours?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]I think so. I didn't pay attention to the area where I left it.
[NAME=Spark][SPEAKERSPRITE=]According to my data, you are in need of 9 parts.
A headlight, rear axle, engine, battery, seat, handlebars, suspension, and 2 tires. 
I can give you the suspension but that is all. 
Looking through the garbage around the city would be most helpful.
I might have seen a seat in a dumpster around here.
...
...
You can leave now.
