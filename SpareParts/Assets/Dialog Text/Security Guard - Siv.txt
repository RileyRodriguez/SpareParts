[NAME=Siv][SPEAKERSPRITE=]STOP!
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]WHAT?
[NAME=Siv][SPEAKERSPRITE=]You cannot enter.
You may be a thief.
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Do I look like a thief to you?
[NAME=Siv][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Everyone looks like a thief.
You are no different.
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]How can I prove to you that I'm not going to steal anything.
[NAME=Siv][SPEAKERSPRITE=]You can't.
...
Actually...
If you bring me my flask, I can see about letting you in.
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Why a flask? Can you even drink?
[NAME=Siv][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Don't question me!
You either give me my flask or you don't get in. Your decision.
