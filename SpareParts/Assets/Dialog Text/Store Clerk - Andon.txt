[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Why, hello.
I haven't seen a new person in so long.
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Your barrier may be to blame.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Barrier?
I took that down a long time ago. 
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Well, there is one. 
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]That blasted robot.
I told them to go away.
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Who?
There wasn’t anyone out there. 
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]AUT0 pretends to help by keeping “thieves” out. 
All they’re doing is running off customers.
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Oh, well I’m sorry to hear that.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]It’ll be alright. I’ll have a chat with them.
Anyway, what can I do for ya?
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Do you happen to have a headlight?
I need to find one so that I can get on out of the city.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]I believe we have one of those. Let me scan the shop right quick.
...
...
There should be one in that green bin next to the benches.
[NAME=Zeta][SPEAKERSPRITE=]How much do I owe you for it?
I don't have much.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Nonsense! You can just have it as long as you go fish it out.
Looks like someone just left it in here one day.
It was nice to talk to a stranger so I'll give it to ya free of charge.
Good luck on your journey!
