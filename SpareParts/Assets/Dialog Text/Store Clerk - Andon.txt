[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Why, hello.
I haven't seen a new person in so long.
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Your security guard may be to blame. 
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Security Guard?
I don't have a security guard.
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]AUT0 outside? 
They wouldn't let me without an argument.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]That blasted robot. 
I told them to go away. 
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Um... yeah
Would you mind if I asked you for a favor?
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Of course not, what can I do for ya?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Do you happen to have a gear?
I need to find a few so that I can get on out of the city.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]I believe we have one of those. Let me scan the shop right quick. 
...
...
There should be one in that green bin next to the benches.  
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]How much do I owe you for it?
I don't have much.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Nonsense! You can just have it as long as you go fish it out.
Looks like someone just left it in here one day.
It was nice to talk to a stranger so I'll give it to ya free of charge.
Good luck on your journey!
