[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Why, hello.
I haven't seen a new person in so long.
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Your security guard may be to blame. 
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Security Guard?
I don't have a security guard.
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]AUT0 outside? 
They wouldn't let me in until I gave them (some item that's found in the trash).
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]That blasted robot. 
I told them to go away. 
They just want someone to find their lost (whatever item that you found)for them. 
They keep coming in here to see if someone has tried to sell it and I keep telling them that it is probably out in the trash.
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Well, I guess you were right.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Where'd you find it? The trash?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Yep, exactly.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]They should have just listened to me and all of this confusion coulda been avoided. 
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Um... yeah
Would you mind if I asked you for a favor?
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Of course not, what can I do for ya?
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Do you happen to have (name of item that Twins wanted)?
I need to find one so that I can get on out of the city.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]I believe we have one of those. Let me scan the shop right quick. 
...
...
Here it is, one (name of part) just for ya. 
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]How much do I owe you for it?
I don't have much.
[NAME=Andon][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Nonsense! You can just have it.
Looks like someone just left this in here one day so I added it to my stock.
It was nice to talk to a stranger so I'll give it to ya free of charge.
