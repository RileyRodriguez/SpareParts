Note: Arguing and want player to retrieve item from Andon for them. They think that Andon stole it and they want you to get it back.

[NAME=M1][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Maybe they'll hear us if we yell again.
[NAME=M2][SPEAKERSPRITE=]They haven't hear us his whole time, why would they hear us now?
There's no use.
[NAME=M1][SPEAKERSPRITE=]HELLO!
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Calm down!
There's no need to yell. I'm right here.
[NAME=M2][SPEAKERSPRITE=]I told you that it was pointless to yell.
[NAME=M1][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Well, they're here aren't they. 
Seems like it worked pretty well.
[NAME=M2][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Whatever. 
[NAME=You][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Who are you?
[NAME=Mach][SPEAKERSPRITE=]I'm Mach and that one is Mecha. 
You can ignore her. She's just mad that Andon took her (item). 
[NAME=Mecha][SPEAKERSPRITE=]Why do they even need the (item)?! No one ever goes in their shop anyway.
